Rules of OCPKata
================

**0. Write the first failing test. Then write a factory that returns an object, or an aggregate of objects, that make the test pass.**
The factory should be limited to creating objects and linking them together. No conditionals allowed.

**1. Write the next failing test.**

**2. Can you make it pass by changing the factory and/or creating a new class and nothing else?
- If yes, great! Go back to 1.
- If not, refactor until you can.**

The refactoring should bring the system to a state where itâ€™s possible to implement the next test just by changing the aggregate of objects that is returned by the factory. Be careful not to implement new functionality; the current test should still fail.
